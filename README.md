### 🌟 Project Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive **Uber Data Analysis** project built with **Microsoft Power BI**. Designed for data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and urban planners, this dashboard transforms raw trip data into actionable insights.

It solves the challenge of understanding complex trip patterns by visualizing key metrics like pickup/drop-off densities, trip durations, and revenue generation in a sleek, interactive interface.

### 🚀 Key Features
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: A fully dynamic `.pbix` report allowing deep-dives into specific timeframes and locations.
- **🗺️ Geospatial Intelligence**: Visual maps tracking `Pick-up` and `Drop-off` hotspots to identify high-demand zones.
- **💰 Revenue Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of fares, dissecting revenue by vehicle type (SUV, Sedan, etc.) and time of day.
- **📈 Operational KPIs**: Real-time tracking of:
  - Total Trips
  - Average Wait Times
  - Trip Durations
  - Earnings per Mile
- **📱 Responsive Layout**: Optimized for clear viewing on desktop screens.

### 🛠️ Technical Architecture
The analysis is built on a robust data modeling foundation within Power BI.
